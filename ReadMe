Just a small application that launches TGD.exe and autosaves projects every 20 seconds - nothing more annoying that working on
a project and it crashes!

Autosave can be turned on or off via the notification tray icon.

When you first launch the program it will ask you to browse the TGD.exe, it then stores this in the registry for use next time it
launches.
